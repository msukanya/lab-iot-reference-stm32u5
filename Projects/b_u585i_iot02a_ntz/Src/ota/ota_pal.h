 * @note The previous image may be present in the designated image download partition or file, so the
 * partition or file must be completely erased or overwritten in this routine.
 *
 * @note The input OtaFileContext_t pFileContext is checked for NULL by the OTA agent before this
 * function is called.
 * The device file path is a required field in the OTA job document, so pFileContext->pFilePath is
 * checked for NULL by the OTA agent before this function is called.

 * @param[in] pFileContext OTA file context information.
 *
 * @return The OTA PAL layer error code combined with the MCU specific error code. See OTA Agent

 * OtaPalBootInfoCreateFailed is returned if the bootloader information file creation fails.
